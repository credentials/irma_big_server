                  <p>
                    The
                    Dutch <a href="https://english.bigregister.nl/">BIG-register</a>
                    contains data about health professionals who are
                    registered in The Netherlands, in particular their
                    professions and registration numbers. In case you
                    occur in the BIG-register, you can load these
                    attributes from the BIG-register into your IRMA
                    app. This allows you to prove to others, for
                    instance during login, that you exercise a certain
                    medical profession, including your registration
                    number.
                  </p>

                  <p>This requires two things:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      You are at this moment actually registered in
                      the <a href="https://english.bigregister.nl/">BIG-register</a>.</li>
                    <li>
                      U
have <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/download-en/">installed</a>
the IRMA app and you have loaded at least
the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/idin">iDIN
attributes</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
		  
                  <p>
		    In order to obtain attributes from the
		    BIG-register, you first need to disclose a number
		    of attributes about yourself, namely your name,
		    date of birth, and gender. The Privacy by Design
		    foundation uses these data to search the (public)
		    BIG-register and check if you occur in it. If an
		    unambiguous and valid registration is found, the
		    foundation can issue to your IRMA app the
		    following BIG-attributes: your profession, your
		    BIG-number, and your medical
		    specialisation(s). Subsequently, the foundation
		    removes all your data from its systems. If you do
		    not occur in the BIG-register, no attributes are
		    issed.
